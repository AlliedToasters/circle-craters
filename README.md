==============

A crater-counting python plugin for QGIS.

Current Status: In Progress

##Details

* This QGIS plugin is designed to offer an open source alternative to the craterTools plugin for ArcGIS.

* Crater counting is a technique used by planetary scientists to estimate the age of a surface.

* This is my first QGIS plugin

* I do not endeavour to replace all the functionality of ArcGIS craterTools, but start from the basics and work up.

* Collaboration is welcome!

* This project is for my personal use, but hopefully it will also benefit the planetary science community in the future. 

* Once I have a decent product I intend to include this in the QGIS plugin repository

#How to install

1. Copy the entire directory containing the plugin to the QGIS plugin directory. The QGIS plugin directory should be in ~/.qgis2/python/plugins

2. Compile the ui file using pyuic4

3. Compile the resources file using pyrcc4

4. Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager
