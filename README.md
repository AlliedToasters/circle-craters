a planetary science crater-counting plugin for QGIS

Current Status: In Progress

Details:

* This QGIS plugin is designed to offer an open source alternative to the ArcGIS craterTools plugin for ArcGIS

* This is my first QGIS plugin

* I do not endeavour to replace all the functionality of the ArcGIS craterTools, but start from the basics and work up.

* Collaboration is welcome!

* This project is for my personal use, but hopefully it will also benefit the planetary science community in the future. 

* Once I have a decent product I intend to include this in the QGIS plugin repository
